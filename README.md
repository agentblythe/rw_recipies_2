## Chapter 9 - Shared Preferences
- There are multiple ways to save data in an app: to files, in shared preferences and to a SQLite database.
- Shared preferences are best used to store simple, key-value pairs of primitive types like strings, numbers and Booleans.
- An example of when to use shared preferences is to save the tab a user is viewing, so the next time the user starts the app, theyâ€™re brought to the same tab.
- The async/await keyword pair let you run asynchronous code off the main UI thread and then wait for the response. An example is getting an instance of SharedPreferences.
- The shared_preferences plugin should not be used to hold sensitive data. Instead, consider using the flutter_secure_storage plugin.

## Chapter 10 - Serialization With JSON
